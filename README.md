Topics: 
    Subtyping polymorphism: declaring an object as a pointer of a type od derived class, but calling constructor different to the class of the pointer
    + virtual is added before function declaration when you expect derived classes to override a method.
    + Youâ€™ll be using pointers or references to the base class


    + Abstract classes : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE0_F4LpGVc&t=180s 
    virtual enables dynamic binding at runtime(flexibility to be called by different classes)
    are abstract classes limited to have only pure virtual functions -> 1 or more
