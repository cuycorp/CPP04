    + deep copies for dynamically allocated data
    
    Virtual
    +  is added before function declaration when you expect derived classes to override a method.
    + You’ll be using pointers or references to the base class

    + Interface classes :

    virtual enables dynamic binding at runtime(flexibility to be called by different classes)
        - can abstract classes have the default methods
